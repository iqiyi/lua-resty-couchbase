lua-resty-couchbase - Lua couchbase client driver for the ngx_lua based on the cosocket API.

It has been running stably on IQIYI Play Service for more than 5 years, and the online support QPS reaches 20W. Under the OpenResty architecture, CouchBase can be accessed directly from nginx.

使用cosocket纯lua实现的couchbase的client，已经在爱奇艺重要的播放服务稳定运行5年多，线上支持峰值QPS达到20W，在OpenResty架构下面，可以直接从nginx上面访问CouchBase.

Status
======

This library is considered production ready.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a CouchBase client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/#readme

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.5.14](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [OpenResty 1.2.1.14](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required.

Synopsis
========

```lua
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-couchbase/lib/?.lua;;";

    lua_shared_dict ldict 10m;

    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua_block {
                local cjson = require "cjson"
                local couchbase = require "resty.couchbase"

                local function get_from_service()
                    -- nothing
                    return "{}"
                end

                local conf = {
                    hosts = { "10.10.10.1:8091", "10.10.10.2:8091"},

                            if value_bak then
                                ngx.log(ngx.WARN, "get key from replica success: ", key)

Debugging
=========

It is usually convenient to use the [lua-cjson](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson.php) library to encode the return values of the couchbase command methods to JSON. For example,

```lua
    local cjson = require "cjson"
    ...
    local res, err = client:get("h1234")
    if res then
        print("res: ", cjson.encode(res))
    end
```

Automatic Error Logging
=======================

By default the underlying [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/#readme) module
does error logging when socket errors happen. If you are already doing proper error
handling in your own Lua code, then you are recommended to disable this automatic error logging by turning off [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/#readme)'s [lua_socket_log_errors](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/#lua_socket_log_errors) directive, that is,

```nginx
    lua_socket_log_errors off;
```

Check List for Issues
=====================

1. Ensure you configure the connection pool size properly in the [set_keepalive](#set_keepalive) . Basically if your NGINX handle `n` concurrent requests and your NGINX has `m` workers, then the connection pool size should be configured as `n/m`. For example, if your NGINX usually handles 1000 concurrent requests and you have 10 NGINX workers, then the connection pool size should be 100.
2. Ensure you are not using too short timeout setting in the [set_timeout](#set_timeout) or [set_timeouts](#set_timeouts) methods. If you have to, try redoing the operation upon timeout and turning off [automatic error logging](#automatic-error-logging) (because you are already doing proper error handling in your own Lua code).
3. If your NGINX worker processes' CPU usage is very high under load, then the NGINX event loop might be blocked by the CPU computation too much. Try sampling a [C-land on-CPU Flame Graph](https://github.com/agentzh/nginx-systemtap-toolkit#sample-bt) and [Lua-land on-CPU Flame Graph](https://github.com/agentzh/stapxx#ngx-lj-lua-stacks) for a typical NGINX worker process. You can optimize the CPU-bound things according to these Flame Graphs.
4. If your NGINX worker processes' CPU usage is very low under load, then the NGINX event loop might be blocked by some blocking system calls (like file IO system calls). You can confirm the issue by running the [epoll-loop-blocking-distr](https://github.com/agentzh/stapxx#epoll-loop-blocking-distr) tool against a typical NGINX worker process. If it is indeed the case, then you can further sample a [C-land off-CPU Flame Graph](https://github.com/agentzh/nginx-systemtap-toolkit#sample-bt-off-cpu) for a NGINX worker process to analyze the actual blockers.

Limitations
===========

* This library cannot be used in code contexts like init_by_lua*, set_by_lua*, log_by_lua*, and
header_filter_by_lua* where the ngx_lua cosocket API is not available.
